For example, if your net operating income is $500,000 and your total amount of debt is $200,000, your DSCR would be 2.5. That means your business has two and a half times the amount of cash it needs to cover its current debt obligations.

Lenders usually use DSCR as an indicator of loan risk — businesses with lower DSCR are considered riskier than those with higher DSCR. A DSCR of 1 essentially means your business is breaking even, while anything below 1 means your business doesn’t have enough cash to cover your debts.
