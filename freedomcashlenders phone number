An alternative to debt financing, equity financing is a method of financing whereby a business owner trades equity, or shares of business ownership, for funding. Venture capital, angel investors and crowdfunding are all methods of equity financing.

Equity financing is best for high-potential startups that will likely experience fast growth. If you don’t get enough money to support your business’s growth, you may end up with a funding gap, or lose ownership in your company.

Inactivity fee

Like a draw fee, an inactivity fee typically accompanies a business credit line. If you don’t use your credit line at all within a certain time period, your lender may charge you an inactivity fee.
Interest

Interest is calculated as a percentage of the principal amount borrowed. Your loan agreement should detail both your interest rate and the total amount of interest you will pay on the loan based on the loan amount.
