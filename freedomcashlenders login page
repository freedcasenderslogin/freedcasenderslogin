A loan is considered to be in default when you repeatedly violate the terms of your specific loan agreement, which means that the exact definition of loan default varies by lender and loan. If you make a late payment, for example, your loan may be considered delinquent for the amount of time that your payment is past due, and you may be subject to late fees. However, if you still haven’t made the payment after a certain period — usually 30 to 90 days —  your lender may report it to a credit bureau.

Draw fees are associated with business lines of credit. You may be subject to a draw fee each time you use your approved credit line.
Equity

Equity represents the value of a company and is calculated by subtracting that company’s liabilities from its assets.

Equity also refers to ownership in a company, represented as a percentage or as a number of shares. In smaller, private companies, equity is normally held by the owners, investors or employees, whereas larger, publicly traded companies distribute equity on the stock market.
